            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Asynchronous programming in JavaScript involves handling operations that might take some time to complete without blocking the execution. It typically uses callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Arrow functions are a concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript. They have a shorter syntax and lexically bind the this value.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓async is used to define asynchronous functions, and await is used to wait for a promise to resolve before proceeding to the next line of code. They are part of the async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓null is an assignment value that represents no value or no object, while undefined is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓These blocks are used for exception handling.

            <div class="accordion-content">

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The Event Loop is a core concept in JavaScript that allows the execution of asynchronous tasks. It continuously checks the call stack and task queue, moving tasks from the queue to the stack when the stack is empty.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓let allows variable reassignment, while const does not. Variables declared with const must be assigned a value when declared and cannot be reassigned.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control access to resources on a different origin. It prevents web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The map function is used to create a new array by applying a provided function to each element in the original array. It does not mutate the original array.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The bind method is used to create a new function with a specified this value and initial arguments. It allows you to explicitly set the context in which a function is called.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, while asynchronous programming allows tasks to be executed independently, often using mechanisms like callbacks, promises, or async/await.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The Same-Origin Policy is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This helps prevent malicious actions such as cross-site request forgery.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Errors in JavaScript can be handled using try-catch blocks, where potentially error-prone code is placed in the try block, and any caught exceptions are handled in the catch block.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope. Closures are useful for creating private variables and implementing the module pattern.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Arrow functions do not have their own this context; instead, they inherit this from the enclosing scope. Regular functions, on the other hand, have their own this context.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The Promise object is used for asynchronous programming. It represents a value that might be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises help handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable way.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, making them more efficient. It is often used in scenarios such as handling user input to delay the execution of a function until after a certain period of inactivity.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a common ancestor instead of individual elements. It takes advantage of event bubbling, allowing you to handle events for multiple elements efficiently.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Both localStorage and sessionStorage are web storage options for storing data on the client side. The key difference is that data stored in localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, while data in sessionStorage is only available for the duration of the page session.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The Event Loop in Node.js is a mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, making it highly scalable. It enables handling multiple connections simultaneously without the need for multi-threading.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The Prototype Chain is a mechanism by which objects in JavaScript inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has an associated prototype object, forming a chain that ends with the Object.prototype at the top.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The fetch API is used to make network requests in JavaScript. It provides a more modern and flexible alternative to the older XMLHttpRequest and is commonly used for fetching data from a server.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Event handling involves responding to user actions or browser events. Event listeners are functions that are invoked when a specified event occurs, allowing you to define custom behavior for different events.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Closures are functions that have access to variables from their outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. They are useful for creating private variables and maintaining state across function calls.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Both call and apply are methods that allow you to invoke a function with a specified this value and arguments. The difference is in how arguments are passed: call takes individual arguments, while apply takes an array of arguments.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Callback hell, also known as the "pyramid of doom," occurs when multiple nested callbacks make the code difficult to read and maintain. It can be mitigated using techniques like named functions, modularization, and promises or async/await syntax.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The window object represents the global browser window and includes properties like document, location, and others. The document object, on the other hand, represents the HTML document and provides methods to manipulate its content.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The bind method is used to create a new function with a specified this value. It does not invoke the function immediately but allows you to create a partially applied function with a specific context.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Promises represent a value that might be available now, in the future, or never. They help with asynchronous programming by providing a cleaner way to handle and chain asynchronous operations, avoiding callback hell.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓The async attribute tells the browser to execute the script asynchronously while the HTML document continues to be parsed. The defer attribute, on the other hand, defers script execution until after the HTML document is fully parsed.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>👩‍🎓Memoization is a technique to optimize function calls by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. It is often used to improve performance in recursive or computationally expensive functions.</p>
